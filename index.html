        <h3>Python Vs Other Language</h3>
<p>Python Syntax compared to other programming languages</p>
<ul>
<li>Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.</li>
<li>Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses. </li>
<li>Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. 
  Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Difference between C and Python</h3> 
<p> The most significant differences between C and Python programming are as follows.</p>
<ul>

<li>C is a procedural language, while Python is an object-oriented language.
<li>C is a compiled language, while Python is an interpreted language. .</li>
<li>C is a static-type language, and the data type of each variable is defined prior to the execution of the program. 
  On the other hand, Python is a dynamically typed language and the data type of each variable is determined at runtime. .</li>
<li>Due to static typing and being a compiled language, Programs written in C are very fast. 
  Whereas Python is an interpreted and dynamically typed language, 
  due to which python programs are very slow compared to programs written in C. .</li>
<li>C has a concept of simple variables as well as pointers. Whereas Python has no concept of pointers, 
  and each variable in Python is a reference to an object.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Difference between Python and Java</h3>
     <p> The most significant differences between programming in python and java are as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Java is a statically typed language, while Python is a dynamically typed language.</li>
<li>Java programs are compiled into bytecodes, and then they are executed in JVMs, 
  while python programs are directly interpreted by the interpreter. .</li>
<li>Java has a complex syntax when compared to Python, while python programs have very good readability. .</li>
<li>In Java, curly braces are used to define blocks of code, while Python uses indentation to define blocks of code. .</li>
<li>Java programs are first compiled and then interpreted, while Python is a completely interpreted language. .</li>
</ul>

      <header>Variables</header>
      <p>
        A Python variable is a reserved memory location to store values. 
        In other words, a variable in a python program gives data to the computer for processing. 
        Every value in Python has a datatype. 
        Different data types in Python are Numbers, List, Tuple, Strings, Dictionary, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Python is not “statically typed”. We do not need to declare variables before using them or declare their type. 
        A variable is created the moment we first assign a value to it. 
        A variable is a name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a program.
        </p>

        <p>The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution.
        A variable is only a name given to a memory location, 
        all the operations done on the variable effects that memory location.</p>
        <h4>Rules for creating variables in Python:</h4>
        <ul>
       <li> A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.</li>
       <li> A variable name cannot start with a number.</li>
        <li>A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).</li>
        <li> Variable names are case-sensitive (name, Name and NAME are three different variables).</li>
          <li>The reserved words(keywords) cannot be used naming the variable.</li>
      </ul>

      <article>
        <p>Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created when some value is assigned to it.</p>
        <h4>How to declare a variable in Python?</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Just name the variable.</li>
        <li> Assign the required value to it.</li>
          <li> The data type of the variable will be automatically determined from the value assigned, we need not define it explicitly.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Python Variable Types</h4>
          <p>Every value in Python has a datatype. 
          Different data types in Python are Numbers, List, Tuple, Strings, Dictionary, etc. 
          Variables in Python can be declared by any name or even alphabets like a, aa, abc, etc.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
      <header>Variable scope</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          The scope of a variable refers to the context in which that variable is visible/accessible to the Python interpreter.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          In Python, variables are the containers for storing data values. 
          They are reference, or pointers, to an object in memory which means that whenever a variable is assigned to an instance, 
          it gets mapped to that instance. 
          Unlike other languages like C/C++/JAVA, Python is not “statically typed”. 
          We do not need to declare variables before using them or declare their type. 
          A variable is created the moment we first assign a value to it.
        </p>
        <code>x = 7 
              y = 8
              z = x + y
              print(z) 
              >>> 15</code>
        <p>
          The scope of a variable in python is that part of the code where it is visible. 
          Actually, to refer to it, you don't need to use any prefixes then.

          Let's take an example, but before let's revise python Syntax.

          <code>>>> b = 8
            >>> def func():
              a = 7
              print(a)
              print(b) 
              >>> func() 
            </code>            
           <h4>Output</h4>
            <code>
            >>> 7
            >>> 8
            </code>

      <header>Global variables</header>
      <article>
        <p>A variable created in the main body of the Python code is a global variable and belongs to the global scope.</p>
          <p>Global variables are available from within any scope, global and local.</p>
  
        
         <h4> Global variables</h4>
          <p>Global variables are the ones that are defined and declared outside any function and are not specified to any function.
             They can be used by any part of the program.

        <p>
          A constant is a type of variable whose value cannot be changed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <p>Python Constants are basically those variables whose values do not change during the program implementation.</p>
            <ul>
          <li>Python is basically a programming language that makes complex programs easier to 
            understand and implement also; it is used in commercial applications.</li>
          <li>These constants are basically assigned to a document.</li>
          <li>The document consists of variables and functions, which are therefore recorded in the main file.</li>
          <li>The constants are thus written inside this main file in 
            capital letters and underscores by isolating the words.</li>
        </ul>
          <h4>Assigning and Declaring Python Constants</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The first and foremost thing to remember while declaring 
              Python Constants is that the constant values should always be declared in capital letters/uppercase.</li>
              <li>The values declared should not be abbreviations of the names, and it has to be declared completely.</li>
        </ul>
          <p>Example:</p>
          
          <code>
          PI = 3.14
          GRAVITY = 9.8
        </code>

      <article>
        <h4>Basic Data Types in Python</h4>
<p>A data type is a characteristic that tells the compiler (or interpreter) how a
programmer intends to use the data. There are two general categories of data types, 
differing whether the data is changeable after definition:
</p>
<ul>

<li>1. Immutable. Data types that are not changeable after assignment.</li>

<li>2. Mutable. Data types that are changeable after assignment.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Numeric Type</h4>
<p>Numeric type objects represent number values. They are divided into three subgroups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integers</li>
<li>Floating Point Numbers</li>
<li>Complex Numbers</li>
</ul>
<h4>Sequence Type</h4>
<p>Sequence types help represent sequential data stored into a single variable. There are three types of sequences used in Python:</p>
<ul>
<li>String</li>
<li>List</li>
<li>Tuple</li>
</ul>
<h4>Boolean Type</h4>
<p>Boolean data types belong to the bool class and determine the truth value of expressions. 
  Objects of the Boolean type evaluate either to <b>True </b> or <b>False</b>  </p>
      
<h4>Set Type </h4>
<p>The Set data type is part of the set class. It stores data collections into a single variable. 
  Sets are unordered and do not allow access to individual elements through indexing. 
Any duplicate values are ignored.</p>
<h4>Mapping Type</h4>
<p>Mapping data type is represented by a Python dictionary. 
A dictionary is a collection of data with key and value pairs belonging to the dict class.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
      <header>if...else statement</header>
      <article>
        <p>An if else Python statement evaluates whether an expression is true or false. 
        If a condition is true, the “if” statement executes. Otherwise, the “else” statement executes. 
        Python if else statements help coders control the flow of their programs.</p>
        <p>An else statement can be combined with an if statement. 
          An else statement contains the block of code that executes 
          if the conditional expression in the if statement resolves to 0 or a FALSE value.
          The else statement is an optional statement and there could be at most only one else statement following if.
          </p>
          <p>Syntax
          The syntax of the if...else statement is</p>
          <code>
          if expression:
             statement(s)
          else:
             statement(s)
            </code>
      <h4>The elif Statement</h4>
    <p>The elif statement allows you to check multiple expressions for TRUE 
            and execute a block of code as soon as one of the conditions evaluates to TRUE.
            Similar to the else, the elif statement is optional. However, unlike else, 
            for which there can be at most one statement, 
            there can be an arbitrary number of elif statements following an if.</p>
                                <code>
                              syntax
                              if expression1:
                                statement(s)
                              elif expression2:
                                statement(s)
                              elif expression3:
                                statement(s)
                              else:
                                statement(s)
                              </code>
  
        <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
        condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
        Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
        condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
        statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement,
        including further nested if statements.
        <p>
          The 'if' condition statement is the most frequently used condition statement in python programming. 
          The 'if' statement is used to evaluate whether a set of code needs to be executed or not.  
          If the statement is true, the flow happens like executing a below code set; when false, 
          then move into the next code set. Here the else's role 
          if statement is to get reevaluated with a different set of conditions when the condition check fails.
        </p>
        <code
          ># Python program to illustrate if-elif-else
          # Variable Declaration section
          check_variable = 20

          if  (check_variable == 2):
          print ("check_variable is 2")
          elif (check_variable == 4):
          print ("check_variable is 4")
          elif (check_variable == 6):
          print ("check_variable is 6")
          elif (check_variable == 8):
          print ("check_variable is 8")
          elif (check_variable == 10):
          print ("check_variable is 10")
          elif (check_variable == 12):
          print ("check_variable is 12")
          elif (check_variable == 14):
          print ("check_variable is 14")
          elif (check_variable == 16):
          print ("check_variable is 16")
          elif (check_variable == 18):
          print ("check_variable is 18")
          elif (check_variable == 20):
          print ("check_variable is 20")
          else:
          print ("check_variable is not present")
        </code>
        <h4>OUTPUT</h4>
        <code>
            check_variable is 20
        </code>
        In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which
        evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group
        them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice
        to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:

        <p>The "while" statement in python is an important control flow statement that enables
           repetitive execution of statements.</p>

        <p>>Syntax of "while" statement in python:</p>
        while <Conditional Expression>:
         <code>   # While suit
            Python statement1
            Python statement2
            Python statement3
            .
            .
            .
            Python statement n

        <h5>Semantics of "while" statement in python:</h5>
        <ul>
        <li>The "while" statement executes a suit of code as long as the conditional expression 
          mentioned in the while statement evaluates to True.</li>
        <li>The "while" statement terminates its execution when the conditional expression evaluates to False.</li>
        <li>The "else" suit is executed once the while suit is exited</li>
        <li>The "else" suit will not be executed if the "while" has exited as a result of a "break" statement.</li>
        <li> "while" is the only loop control statement that can be controlled by a index variable used as part of its conditional expression.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <p>Example:</p>
        <code>
        index = 0
        while (index < 10):
            print("Index Value: {}".format(index))
            index = index + 1 #increment explicitly
        else:
            print("Done with printing numbers"

        <p>
          A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. 
          Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.
        </p>
         <p> As you already know, Python gives you many built-in functions like print(), etc. 
            but you can also create your own functions. 
            These functions are called user-defined functions.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Defining a Function </h4>
<p>You can define functions to provide the required functionality. Here are simple rules to define a function in Python.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Function blocks begin with the keyword def followed by the function name and parentheses ( ( ) ).
</li>
<li>Any input parameters or arguments should be placed within these parentheses. You can also define parameters inside these parentheses.
</li>
<li>The first statement of a function can be an optional statement - the documentation string of the function or docstring.
</li>
<li>The code block within every function starts with a colon (:) and is indented.
</li>
<li>The statement return [expression] exits a function, optionally passing back an expression to the caller. 
  A return statement with no arguments is the same as return None.
</li>
</ul> 
<h5>Syntax</h5>
<code>
def functionname( parameters ):
"function_docstring"
function_suite
return [expression]
</code>
<h5> Calling a Function </h5>
<p>  Defining a function only gives it a name,
specifies the parameters that are to be included in the function and structures the blocks of code.

Once the basic structure of a function is finalized, 
you can execute it by calling it from another function or directly from the Python prompt. 
Following is the example to call printme() function 
</p>
<code>
# Function definition is here
def printme( str ):
"This prints a passed string into this function"
print str
return;

# Now you can call printme function
printme("I'm first call to user defined function!")
printme("Again second call to the same function")
</code>
<h5> Output </h5>
       <code>
        I'm first call to user defined function!
        Again second call to the same function
       </code>
